# Data-Analysis-Sales-Trends

ðŸ“Œ Dataset Used: file.csv

ðŸ“Œ Tool Used: SQLite (via DB Browser for SQLite)

ðŸ”§ Analysis Features Implemented:

âœ… Performed an in-depth sales trend analysis using SQL queries on the file dataset.

âœ… Calculated key business metrics:

    Total Monthly Revenue: Sum of Quantity * Avg_Price for each month.
    Total Monthly Order Volume: Count of distinct Transaction_ID for each month.

ðŸ“Š Results Obtained & Analysis:

    Monthly Sales Trends (Line Chart - conceptually): Analyzed overall monthly revenue and order     volume trends, showing how sales and orders fluctuated throughout 2019. The full dataset         returned 12 months of data (plus a NULL entry, likely an artifact of some initial date           parsing or empty rows, which can be excluded).

ðŸ§© Query Customization & Filtering:

âœ… Utilized a WHERE clause to filter the analysis for specific time periods.

    Year/Month Filter: Demonstrated filtering for a specific month (e.g., December 2019) to get      focused insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Analysis Insights:

    Year-End Peak: Both total revenue and order volume show a significant increase towards the       end of the year, peaking in November and December 2019.

    Consistency in Trends: The trends for revenue and order volume largely align, suggesting         that higher sales are driven by a greater number of unique transactions.

    Monthly Fluctuations: While there's an overall upward trend, there are visible monthly           fluctuations, with some dips (e.g., February and May) followed by recovery.
